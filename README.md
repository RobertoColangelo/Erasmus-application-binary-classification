## Data Science in Action Project 
Roberto Colangelo - Davide Rosatelli - Lisa Aita 

The project folder contains the dataset (an .xlsx file) made of 26 instances and 154 attributes, a .ipynb notebook created on google colab and a .py file for those who want to run the code and edit the code. The goal of our roject was that of creating a model capable of classifying and predicting whether a student is likely to apply for the Erasmus exchange program or not.
Data were of poor quality and most of the work consisted in data cleaning/processing and feature engineering. Given the quality of the data and the number of instances, the models seem to perform pretty good (in particular the logistic regression for models created with feature selection)
